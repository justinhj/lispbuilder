CFFI gl.h Mesa v 6.4.2 Wrapper and sample code

See COPYING for license

I've tested this with Lispworks Personal Edition 4.4.6, and CLISP 2.38, although it 
should work on any lisp with working asdf and cffi.

To use:

Start asdf, cffi, lispbuilder-sdl, lispbuilder-sdl-binaries and lispbuilder-opengl
Run (gl-examples:opengl-gears)

To make the wrappers:

Copy sdlswig.i (the swig interface file) to the opengl include directory 
run 'swig -cffi openglswig.i'
