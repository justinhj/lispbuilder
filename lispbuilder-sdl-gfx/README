I've tested these with lispworks personal edition 4.4.6. However these 
bindings should work on any lisp with a working asdf and cffi.

1) To use sdl-gfx: 
1.1) Start asdf.
1.2) Start cffi; 
	(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :cffi)
1.3) Start lispbuilder-sdl;
	(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :lispbuilder-sdl)
1.3) Start lispbuilder-sdl-gfx;
	(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :lispbuilder-sdl-gfx)
1.4) Set the location of the SDL_gfx* DLL;
        (defparameter *sdl-gfx-dll-filepath* "C:\\SDL_gfx-2.0.13\\lib\\SDL_gfx")
	
2) To execute any of the example applications;
2.1) Start lispbuilder-sdl-gfx-examples; 
	(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :lispbuilder-sdl-gfx-examples)
2.2) Run the examples using:
	(sdl-gfx-examples:inbuilt-font)
	(sdl-gfx-examples:random-circles)


3) To create the SDL_gfx CFFI wrappers using SWIG;
3.1) Copy sdlswig.i (the swig interface file) to the SDL_gfx directory.
3.2) Run 'swig -cffi sdlswig.i'


* Precompiled binaries for SDL_gfx are available in the 'binaries' package as part of 
this project (lispbuilder) on Sourceforge. For example, a win32 compatible DLL is located in
the 'lispbuilder-sdl-gfx-binaries_v2.0.13.zip' package.
