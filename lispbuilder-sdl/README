CFFI SDL Wrapper and sample code
(C)2006 Justin Heyes-Jones

See COPYING for license

I've tested these only with lispworks personal edition 4.4.6 although it 
should work on any lisp with working asdf and cffi.

To use:

Start asdf and cffi
Change to the directory with the files in 
(load "load") ; sets up the sdl package, loads the sdl wrapper and a test program
(sdl:test-1) ; run the simple test program

To make the wrappers:

Copy sdlswig.i (the swig interface file) to the SDL include directory
run 'swig -cffi sdlswig.i'

Currently you then have to go into sdl.lisp and find any structures that have 
a data type :void and change it to :pointer. This is something in swig that I need
fixing, I think Surendra has a fix but it's not yet checked in to the SWIG release.

Then you have to find the SDL_Event macros which is doing a lot of 1<< stuff. You need
to comment out all of them to load without error.
