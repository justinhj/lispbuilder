CFFI SDL Wrapper and sample code
(C)2006 Justin Heyes-Jones

See COPYING for license

I've tested these only with lispworks personal edition 4.4.6 although it 
should work on any lisp with working asdf and cffi.

To use:

Start asdf and cffi:

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :cffi)

Then load the lispbuilder-sdl and, optionally, the examples:

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :lispbuilder-sdl)
(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :lispbuilder-sdl-examples)

(sdl:test-1) ; run the simple test program

To make the wrappers (which you don't have to do unless you want to since they're
already made for SDL-1.2.9)

Copy sdlswig.i (the swig interface file) to the SDL include directory

Check the file headerchanges.txt, there are instructions for a handful of things in SDL
that CFFI does not yet handle. You have to manually patch these.

run 'swig -cffi sdlswig.i'

This generates the file sdl.lisp which is the wrapper.
